Context setting regarding the project.

Understanding workflow and setting up our project.


= Details =

1) Vinayak - Task is to create a nice logo for our project. It would be     good to have a logo.

2) The first task that we have to perform is understanding the workflow. Analyze the requirements. How the process takes place at IIIT-D. What are the inputs, how is a request processed and ultimately what is the output. Understanding the workflow and requirement analysis is task one.

In order to do so - lets start meeting the people who are involved in the process and try to know from them how is the work carried out.

For now we need to meet 4 people - Anoop sir, Ajay sir, Amit sir and Suruchi Ma'am. Let 3 people manage this task and visit all 4 people so that they can sequentially know the details and there are no breaks in the process analysis.

Vinayak and Akshay Rajvanshi - You both are free in the morning tomorrow so I request you both to please contact Aishwarya and Paritosh in this regard, form a team and go ahead with this important task.

We need to understand this workflow well, then only we can think of proceeding.
