EQUIP-ME

IIIT-Delhi is a very research intensive institute, where the faculty spends majority of their time working on research projects. The faculty encourage students to be a part of research projects and provide them wonderful opportunities as research assistants and interns.

Every such intensive research requires finances. Conference travels, buying equipment, paying stipends - all require approval from the institute administration. A lot of formalities need to be completed which involves a lot of paperwork.  Since the work is paper-based (not online), a lot of in-person visits are required since several people are involved (result tracking, querying records is very hard). Hence, there is a need for a system which makes these tasks more efficient, thereby increasing productivity.

In this project we propose to automate the current manual process of applying for expenditure on faculty projects like conference travel, research assistants and interns, buying equipment, in IIIT-Delhi. We aim to create an interface for faculty and the administration that digitizes, the task of applying and approving expenditure procedure for the faculty members, currently there is no system in place that automates this procedure.

We even plan to extend this software to all the administrative procedure that transit through multiple authorities and is not automated, there by avoiding delay and errors caused by human interactions.
